# Langgraph-Chatbot-With-Tools
Developed a chatbot system using Langgraph and Gemma2-9b-It to integrate external tools like Arxiv and Wikipedia for enhanced user interaction. Implemented a state graph-based workflow to manage conversation flow and dynamically query external data sources in response to user inputs.

Leveraged Langchain and Groq to bind external tools to the chatbot, allowing the system to retrieve specific documents and information (e.g., from Arxiv or Wikipedia) to provide real-time, data-driven responses.
Designed and optimized chatbot interactions to handle multiple conversational paths, ensuring high customization and user engagement.
Demonstrated the systemâ€™s capability to query and deliver accurate responses from external databases, improving overall information retrieval.
